  I am a third year biology student at UCSB and am interested in ecology, environmental science, and conservation. I decided to begin learning GIS in the summer of 2020 because it is a very useful tool in conservation biology and I believe it will be valuable in my future research. Through this GIS course, I worked with relevant spatial data, such as COVID-19 cases and flood analysis, that exposed me to the basics of geoinformatics and data science and I created this website to share my work. Outside of school, I am very dedicated to the UCSB triathlon team and love doing anything active and outside!
